# Within-host malaria modelling to improve the treatment of malaria

Artemisinin derivatives are the first line treatment for falciparum malaria.
Alarmingly, resistance to these drugs has emerged in Southeast Asia, jeopardizing malaria control.
Mathematical models integrating blood antimalarial drug concentrations with the parasite-time profile of an infected individual provide an avenue to studying drug action.
We have developed biologically informed within-host mathematical models for exploring treatment outcomes following artemisinin-based combination therapies.
We have expanded our model to include transmission dynamics and future developments will incorporate innate and acquired immunity.
We apply state of the art Bayesian methods to validate the within-host models against data from controlled human malaria infection studies and multinational clinical trials.
