# Meta-analyses to inform optimal primaquine radical cure

*P. vivax* requires radical cure for control of blood and liver stages.
Primaquine is the only widely available drug to kill liver stage vivax malaria, however, it can cause severe haemolysis in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.
Many countries and clinicians are reluctant to prescribe primaquine for this reason.
We have used individual patient data meta-analyses undertaken through collaboration with the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN) to improve our understanding of the risks and benefits of primaquine radical cure and inform policymakers.
