# Welcome to qMalaria

![The qMalaria team](home-banner.jpg)

qMalaria are a group of Data Scientists (biostatisticians, mathematical biologists, health economists) using novel quantitative methods to improve the treatment and control of malaria. The research program focusses primarily on malaria, but the methodological advances have widespread applicability to other infectious diseases.

We have developed biologically informed mathematical models for studying antimalarial drug action, Bayesian methods for determining optimal sampling schedules of future antimalarial drug studies, and cost-effectiveness models to improve the management of vivax malaria.
